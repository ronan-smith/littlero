# littlero
Modular, hassle-free and unobtrusive administration and white-labelling plugin for WordPress.

## Installation
LittleRo is designed to work as a **must-use plugin**, unlike normal plugins, must-use plugins can't be managed via the WordPress dashboard - they're uploaded manually, stopping unauthorised users (*you know the type...*) from meddling.

To install, upload `littlero-loader.php` and the `littlero` folder into the `/wp-content/mu-plugins` folder (by default) and you're sorted!
